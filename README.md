## Mask-Noise
Extremely simple script that takes a folder of transparent PNGs and generates a black mask image and a greyscale image with a noise background for training a segmentation network.
Data is unlikely challenging but I wrote this to facilitate testing a network visualisation project - a more challenging background heeds more interesting kernels and intermediate images.
